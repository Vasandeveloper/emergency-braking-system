# 🚗 Emergency Braking System Using Ultrasonic Sensor

A real-time obstacle detection and motor control system using Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, LED, and motor. This system alerts the user with an LED when an object is nearby and stops the motor until the object is cleared.

## 🛠️ Features
- Ultrasonic-based obstacle detection
- Real-time LED alert system
- Motor auto-stop when object detected
- Motor resumes once object is removed

## 📷 Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- LED
- DC Motor
- Transistor or Motor Driver (e.g., L298N)
- Resistors, wires, breadboard

## 💻 Code

```cpp
// Code is in emergency_braking.ino
